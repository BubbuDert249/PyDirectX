# PyDirectX
PyDirectX is a wrapper for DirectX 9, 11 and 12 for Python <br>
It combines PythonNet, SharpDX DLLs and pydx12 into one .whl/.tar.gz Python 3 library <br>
# Troubleshooting
Make sure your OS is Windows 10 or later <br>
Make sure your GPU supports DirectX 9 or later <br>
Make sure you have pythonnet and pydx12 installed <br>
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later <br>
Make sure your Python enviroment is regular Python, not Jython, PyPy or IronPython <br>
The DirectX 9 and 11 version is Direct3D, the 12 version is DirectX <br>
If the pydx12/pythonnet installation fails, go to PyPi and download the local .whl <br>
